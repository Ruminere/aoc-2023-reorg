I spent way too debugging part 2 because I used `i` as my iteration variable and I, out of habit, called my inner loop iteration value `i` as well. This was a pretty chill problem and I wasn't really trying for speed (although sub-2000 for both parts is nice), and I'm grateful for that since I'm not feeling well today.
