# Problem 11
I completed part 1 in 17:04 and was rank 1540, and I completed part 2 in 17:30 (cumulative) and was rank 685. I actually got top 1000 another time... I'm proud of myself. I literally made the goal on day 10 and I achieved it not even 24 hours later.

I implemented the nice solution for part 1 since it would take me less time anyway than to implement the naive solution, and it fed really well into part 2, hence the very low 0:26 difference. (I could've done similarly with day 9 by simply reversing the input list, but didn't think of that way.)
