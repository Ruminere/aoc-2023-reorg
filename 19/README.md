Part 1 was straightforward enough; the `eval` function definitely came in handy here, because else processing the booleans would've taken somewhat longer. Preprocessing took long enough, and I lost time trying to reformat the workflows (`instrs`) because I kept reformatting the ratings (`vals`) instead before I realized what I was doing.

Part 2 reminded me of [Day 5](/05/main1.py), what with splitting the ranges and all. I looked at it and immediately decided to do it later, because it was already 12:35 AM. The bin-splitting algorithm was annoying, especially as I had to debug it as I didn't split the bins correctly, and I left my (commented-out) print statements in there as an indication of how messy my code was.

All things considered, though, these were nice problems.
