I started this question right when it dropped.

For part 1, I used a dictionary-based solution where I stated how many rounded rocks were leaning against a cubed rock. I thought the solution was more clever than manipulating the grid, because I was expecting something with regards to that.

Then come part 2 where I realize I should've just implemented grid manipulation in the first place. Hooray! I knew from reading the problem that the grid would cycle, but I knew it would take me a decent amount of time to implement everything, so I went to bed. Then in the morning I implemented grid manipulation and shifted, then calculated the cycle length and got the answer from there.
