# Problem 9
This problem took me way longer than it should've. I looked at this problem and remembered [something similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation) being taught during math team, so I tried to think up on what the concept was called. I did not find it (I think it might've been called a generating function, but I'm not too sure), so I decided to brute force it. All in all, I took around 10 minutes to even start coding.

I also decided to test out my custom package (aoctools), and had to correct some bugs in it. Due to this, I took quite a long time to code out part 1, though part 2 took less time since it was almost the same as part 1 (I screwed the addition logic up a bit though).

Later, I learned that I could've simply reversed the order of the list for part 2, and that the [recursive solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18e5ytd/comment/kcllx58/) was much faster. It was nice to learn of that solution, though.
