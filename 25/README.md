This is the most elegant solution I've implemented all season if we don't consider [Day 1](/01/main.py). I simply had to Google how to find the minimum cut and connected node groups using NetworkX. Unlike Day 1, though, I got quite the impressive leaderboard scoreâ€”the *actual* best all season, too, and the only sub-300s (and sub-600s) I've gotten! I'm quite proud.
