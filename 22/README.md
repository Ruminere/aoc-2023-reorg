This was a chill question. I first dropped based on maximum z-values. Then I tried to find a smart way to count whether the blocks were safe to remove for part 1, realized the smart solution would take a while to code, then used a bashy olution. That decision served me quite well for part 2, since I didn't have to modify much (I simply had to add a counter for how many blocks dropped).
