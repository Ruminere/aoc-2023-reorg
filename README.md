# aoc-2023 Reorganized

These were my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). I kept the solutions mostly the same as how I had it while coding during the competition, with some edits to explain my code and thought process while coding it out (for the original code, refer to [this repository](https://github.com/Ruminere/aoc-2023)). Thus, some code may be messy.

Due to copyright concerns, u/topaz (the creator of AoC) has requested for us to not share our inputs. Thus, you will have to source them yourself from the site. You are able to access all the questions in any order without having to access earlier questions, provided that you have an account on AoC.

I have added comments for questions [12](./12/), [17](./17/), and [21](./21/), since I feel as those questions best showcase my skills (and because 12 and 21 were my favorite ones from this year), although you are free to peruse my code for the other days as well.
